# CAD-Workshop
ASME 10/8/2025

Hello and welcome! 

This workshop will be structed by the skillsets needed to make the parts at hand. 

1) Beginner: Using UI, Sketching, extruding, cutting.
2) Intermediate: Assemblies, mating, drawings.
3) Advanced: Complex assemblies, surfacing techniques, and much much more

Just know that these are the basics and that you need WAY more time to fully learn everything Solidworks has to offer. 
If y'all want more workshops like these let me know and I can work something out.

Let's be real we're here to have fun. My plan in this workshop is to give you guys fun parts that you'll actually want to make that also look good to start a portfolio. 
And at the end of the workshop I want to give you guys a taste of what it is like to be part of a Speed CAD competition. 

The parts and drawings made here will be available in this repository during and even after the workshop ends.

Hope you all enjoy. GKCO!
